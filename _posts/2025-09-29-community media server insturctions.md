Here I will give instructions on how to access my community media server. It is important to note that the media server is only open to close friends and loved ones for now (this is because i am afraid of what might happen).

I don't know about you but I personally am sick and tired of the way media is consumed in this modern age. I don't like how spotify and netflix take things away from me and I would like to avoid this if at all possible. I started this project originally so that I could upload my CD collection for online streaming. Turns out the media server thing that I used - jellyfin - can host movies, TV, photos, videos, and books as well. This gave me a fantastic idea... What if my friends and loved ones could upload their media that they *legally* obtained for the enjoyment of others? What if everyone added their favourite content into the media "soup" that absorbed the flavours of whoever touched it? That would be beautiful I think, so now I am trying to make that happen!

For security reasons, I've decided to use a vpn to connect to the media server instead of port forwarding. It's also much easier I think. The VPN I've chosen is **tailscale** and the setup could not be simpler:

1. Download tailscale on your device
